## Progressive Web App (PWA) Features

This app is a Progressive Web App with the following features:

- **Offline Functionality**: The app caches essential assets for offline use via a Service Worker.
- **Installable**: Users can install the app on their devices for a native app-like experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop platforms.

To install:
- On Chrome/Android: Look for the install prompt or use the menu.
- On other browsers: Use the custom install banner if available.

For testing PWA compliance, use Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools.
# Roadmap
- touch events compatibility for sliders;
- multiple and shareable saves (sidebar menu and pbbly base64 or some clever usage of url variables);
- who knows? crazy stuff like mcp or some bullshit, lol
